# World Wide Webcam

This is an experimental project for now.

MVP:
* Enable swapping pixel shader (EffectProcessor.ts)
* A single nice effect on/off with tap
* Improve basic UI (janky drop shadow + scale on mobile)
* Typography: roboto?
* Write the "about" info, link to and fill out this readme

Next steps:
* Multiple filters! Selector, slug routes, etc.
* Explore web share API on mobile (faster camera roll save?)
