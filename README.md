# World Wide Webcam

This is an experimental project for now.

To do:
* Clean up CameraCanvas: internal design, external interface, etc.
* Maybe make a lil module for camera device management?

* Fix camera flipping on mobile
* Start breaking things out into proper files
* Tech design: swap in different filters (as slug routes?)
* Basic UI design: capture image, select filter, flip camera
* Finalize MVP with a couple very basic filters, move on

* Maybe do aspect ratio correction in the vertex shader?
